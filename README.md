# SecureVoiceTransmission
Network Security project -
We propose a system which 
1)converts the speech commands into text, 
2)encrypted using Modified RSA, 
3)and hashed with salt 
to be stored anonymously so that the most hackers can get would be random texts of customer preferences. 
The Google Speech API and Socket connections which emulate the communication between assistants and servers, send encrypted data over to the client in text form so that the voice data is not stored and the assistant gets the data it needs to train itself.
